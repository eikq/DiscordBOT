# Cursor Cloud sequential queue status

Updated: 2026-08-20

This is the continuation pointer for the long-running Cloud development
queue. Later queued prompts must **not** restart from
`origin/local/jarvis-acceptance-2026-08-20`.

## Continuation branch

`cursor/jarvis-cloud-evolution-2026-08-20`

Fetch and continue from the latest successfully pushed HEAD of that
branch only. Do not merge. Do not push `main`. Do not force push.

## Queue 01 — Presenter Intelligence + Desktop Presence

Status: **COMPLETE** (cloud-safe software). Not LIVE_VERIFIED.

Base: `8aba6b019c436b1e636f32274607015a4dc23e38`
(`origin/local/jarvis-acceptance-2026-08-20`)

Work landed first on
`cursor/jarvis-presenter-desktop-cloud-2026-08-20-4838` and is now the
starting HEAD of the dedicated evolution branch.

Cloud evidence: `npx tsc --noEmit` PASS; targeted Presenter/Desktop
48/48; `npm run test:cloud` **517/517**.

Labels stay:

- LA-001 **PARTIAL**
- LA-002 **PARTIAL**
- LA-026 **PARTIAL** (live speech↔motion NEEDS_LOCAL_VERIFY)
- LA-027 **PARTIAL — NATIVE_SHELL_REQUIRED**

Native helper is not installed. Do not mark LIVE_VERIFIED from Cloud.

Handoff: `CURSOR_CLOUD_PRESENTER_DESKTOP_HANDOFF.md`.

## Operating constraints still in force

- LLM output ≠ execution
- CapabilityHost / ActionGate remain authoritative
- Jarvis cannot approve itself
- web / model / skills output = untrusted data
- no unrestricted production shell
- no uncontrolled recursive self-modification
- no multi-agent swarm
- no automatic LoRA training / skill promotion / restricted-model routing
